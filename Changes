Revision history for lib-filter

0.18    2015-06-29 (PERLANCAR)

	- Update example because using 'allow_noncore=0 + allow some
	  non-core XS modules' doesn't work because the non-core XS modules
	  will still search for loadable object in @INC; instead we'll use
	  custom filter for this.

	- Add option: debug.


0.17    2015-06-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [testing] Included Module::List::WithPath in t/lib/Module/List.pm
	  instead of t/lib/Module/List/WithPath.pm, derp.


0.16    2015-06-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [testing] Replace Exporter with base, due to failure reports in
	  some system where Exporter is located in non-core dir [CT].


0.15    2015-06-28 (PERLANCAR)

0.14    2015-06-28 (PERLANCAR)

0.13    2015-06-28 (PERLANCAR)

        - [testing] Print list of modules on failure to require.

        - [testing] Remove the use of Test::Exception (unused) and
          IPC::System::Options (replaced with plain system()) so that lib-filter
          now does not depend on any non-core modules.
